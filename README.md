## Description 🐝

This is my web development project for the CEI course, inspired by the film Poor Things directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. The site is a visual and interactive exploration of the movie’s aesthetic, themes, and production elements, with a focus on visual storytelling, layout, and immersive design. It highlights the film’s surreal Victorian-inspired world and the transformation of its main character, Bella Baxter, through a combination of structured content, stylized visuals, and engaging UI elements. The project demonstrates attention to visual hierarchy, responsive structure, and creative use of web technologies to translate cinematic atmosphere into a web experience.
